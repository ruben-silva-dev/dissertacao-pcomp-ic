Many students are adapted to a course that is more theoretical than practical, which ends up making it difficult to implement good practices, since the program is rarely used. By doing more analysis about the simplest things of good practices, during the internship I learned a lot about dividing the code well, indenting, naming methods and variables, etc. It ends up generating a code that is easier to understand, manipulate and maintain.","Generally the programmer is lazy to generate code when you have something ready.
